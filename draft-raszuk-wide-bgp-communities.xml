<abstract>
   
<t>Route tagging plays an important role in external 
<xref target="RFC4271">BGP</xref> relations,
in communicating various routing policies between peers. It 
is also a very common best practice among operators to propagate 
various additional information about routes intra-domain. The 
most common tool used today to attach various information about 
routes is through the use of 
<xref target="RFC1997">BGP communities</xref>.</t> 

<t> Such information is important to allow BGP speakers to 
perform some mutually agreed upon actions without the need to 
maintain a separate offline database for each tuple of prefix 
and associated set of action entries.</t>

<t> This document defines a new encoding which will enhance 
and simplify what can be accomplished today with the use of 
BGP communities. The most important addition this specification 
makes over currently defined BGP communities is the ability to
specify, carry as well as use for execution an operator's defined
set of parameters. It also provides an extensible platform 
for any new community encoding needs in the future.</t>

<section title="Introduction">

<t><xref target="RFC1997">RFC 1997</xref> defines the BGP 
Community Attribute.  This attribute is used as a tool to
carry additional information in BGP routes
which may help to automate peering administration.
The BGP Communities 
Attribute consists of one or more sets of four octet values, 
where each specifies a different community. Except for
two reserved ranges, the encoding of community values mandates 
that the first two octets are to contain the Autonomous System 
number, with the next two octets containing some locally defined 
value.</t>

<t> With the introduction of 4-octet Autonomous System numbers 
by <xref target="RFC4893">RFC 4893</xref> it became obvious 
that BGP Communities as specified in RFC 1997 will not be able
to accommodate new AS encoding. In fact RFC 4893 explicitly 
recommends use of 
<xref target="RFC5668">four octets AS specific</xref>
<xref target="RFC4360">extended communities</xref>
as a way to encode new 4 octet AS numbers.</t>

<t> While the encoding of 4 octet AS numbers is being addressed 
by [draft-ietf-idr-as4octet-extcomm-generic-subtype], neither the 
base BGP communities (standard or extended) nor 
as4octet-extcomm-generic document define a sufficient level of 
encoding freedom which could be of practical use. The authors 
believe that defining a new BGP Path Attribute, with the ability 
to contain locally defined parameters will 
enhance the current level of network policies, as well as simplify 
BGP policy management. The proposed simple encoding will also 
facilitate the delivery of new network services without a 
need to define a new BGP extension each time.</t>

<t>When defining any new type of tool there is always a 
unique opportunity to specify a subset of well recognized 
behaviors. Lists of the current most commonly used BGP communities,
as well as provision for a new registry for future definitions
will be contained in a separate document.</t>

</section>

<section title="Wide BGP Community Attribute">

<t>This document defines a new BGP Path Attribute, the Wide BGP Community.  The
attribute type code is (TBA by IANA).</t>

<t>The Wide BGP Community Attribute is an optional, transitive BGP 
attribute, and may be present only once in the 
update message.</t>

<t>The attribute contains a number of typed containers. Any given 
container type may appear multiple times, unless that container 
type's definition specifies otherwise.</t>

<section title="Wide BGP Community Attribute Container Header">

    <postamble>Flags are defined globally, to apply to all wide community container
               types.</postamble>
  </texttable>

<t>Bit 0 set (value 1) indicates that the given container carries a Wide BGP
Community which is registered with IANA. When not set (value 0) it indicates
that community value which follows is locally assigned with a local meaning.
Ignored bits SHOULD be preserved in any received containers, or set to 0
otherwise.</t>

<t>Bit 1 is used to manage the propagation scope of a given Wide BGP Community
across confederation boundaries. When not set (value of 0), the Hop Count field
is not considered at the sub-AS boundaries. When set (value of 1), sub-AS
border router follows the same procedure regarding the handling of the Hop Count
field as applicable to ASBR at the domain boundary.</t>

<t>The Hop Count field represents the forwarding radius, in units of AS 
hops, for the given Wide BGP Community.  A Hop Count value of zero indicates
that this wide community must not cross any further AS boundaries.  At each AS
boundary, when propagating a given wide community over an EBGP session, the Hop
Count field MUST be decremented by the sending EBGP speaker.</t>

<t>The exact same decrement procedures described above apply
also to sub-confederation boundaries when the bit 1's flag is set 
to 1.</t>

<t>The special value of 0xFF indicates that the enclosed community 
may always be propagated over an EBGP boundary. A Hop Count value of 0xFF 
MUST NOT be decremented during propagation. </t>

<t>The length represents the total lengths of a given container 
in octets.</t>

</section>

<section title="Wide Community Atoms">

<t>Wide BGP communities will act on and hence need to encode some distinct
atoms of data.  These are encoded as Sub-TLVs, where each Sub-TLV has the
following format:</t>

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
</artwork>
<postamble></postamble>
</figure>

<t>The Sub-Type field contains a value of 0-254.  The value 255 is reserved for
future use. The sub-TLV types are to be assigned and maintained by IANA
registry. </t>

<t>The length represents the total length of a given sub-TLV 
in octets.</t>

<t>The value field contains the sub-TLV value.</t>

<t>Supported format of the sub-TLVs can be:</t>

<figure><preamble></preamble><artwork>
- Type 1:     4 octets : Autonomous System number
- Type 2:  1..5 octets : IPv4 prefix (1 octet prefix length + prefix)
- Type 3: 1..17 octets : IPv6 prefix (1 octet prefix length + prefix)
- Type 4:     4 octets : Integer
- Type 5:     variable : UTF-8 String
- Type 6:     4 octets : IEEE Floating Point Number
- Type 7:     variable : Grouping Container (for logical AND)
- Type 8:     1  octet : Neighbor Class
</artwork><postamble></postamble></figure>

<t>The semantics of a given atom will depend on the context it is used as
defined by the containing wide community.</t>

<t>For consistent treatment, all AS numbers MUST be encoded as 4 octet
values. When encoding two octet ASes, the first two octets of this four octet
value MUST be filled with zeros.</t>

<t>Two special values are reserved for the Autonomous 
System atom:
<list>
<t>0x00000000 - to indicate "No Autonomous Systems".</t>
<t>0xFFFFFFFF - to indicate "All Autonomous Systems".</t>
</list></t>

<t>The Grouping Container is intended for use for Wide Community Targets.
Targets typically have a "match any" behavior.  When a Grouping Container 
is present in a target, all contained atoms must match for the community to be
applied.</t>

<t>The Neighbor Class atom represents a classification of a BGP peering
session.  This class currently can contain three values:
   <list>
      <t>1 - Peer: This class is typically applied to sessions where a transit-free relationship exists between two providers.</t>
      <t>2 - Customer: This class is typically applied to sessions where the remote end of the session is operated by a customer.</t>
      <t>3 - Upstream: This class is typically applied to sessions where the remote end of the session is operated by a network from which you receive transit routes.</t>
   </list>

Number indicates the AS that defines the format of this wide community for the
given Local Value.  (In other words, value 1 will likely refer to different
formats for AS 1 vs. AS 2.)</t>

</list></t>

</section>

<section title="Wide Community Target(s) TLV">

<t>Type: 1</t>

<t>The Wide Community Target(s) TLV has the same format as a Wide Community
atom.</t>

<t>Wide Community Targets define the matching criteria for the community.
A given wide community may have a number of targets that it applies to.  The
semantics of these targets will vary on a per community basis.  Depending on
the definition of the community, targets may be optional.</t>

<t>The value field of the Wide Community Target(s) TLV is a series of Wide
Community Atom TLVs.  The semantics of any given atom TLV MUST be part of the
definition of a given Wide Community.</t>

<t>Typically, Wide Community Targets consist of a series of atoms that have
"match any" semantics.  Thus, if any given target matches per the semantics of
that atom for the community, the community is considered to match and the
action defined by the community should be executed.</t>

<t>The Grouping Container atom permits a set of atoms with semantics defined by
the community to be nested.  The Grouping Container atom is considered to be a
matching target if, and only if, all of its contained atoms match per the
semantics of the community.</t>

<t>If the semantics of a given atom is undefined for the community in question,
it MUST be ignored.  If an atom with undefined semantics is part of a Grouping
Container, the entire container MUST be ignored.</t>

<t>When no targets are required by the definition of a given Wide Community,
the Wide Community Target TLV SHOULD NOT be encoded in the community.
Implementations MUST be prepared to accept a Wide Community Target TLV with an
empty value field.</t>

</section>

<section title="Wide Community Parameter(s) TLV">

<t>Type: 2</t>

<t>The Wide Community Parameter(s) TLV has the same format as a Wide Community
atom.</t>

<t>A given wide community may have parameters which are used as inputs for
executing actions defined for that community.  These parameters, and any
constraints implied by the parameters, MUST be defined by the wide community
definition.  Parameters consist of an ordered set of atom sub-TLVs.  The
semantics of any specific positional instance of an atom MUST be defined by the
wide community.</t>

<t>If it is the case that a paramter for a given community is of an unexpected
type, the community MUST be ignored.</t>

<t>If it is the case that there are too many or two few parameters for a given
community, the community MUST be ignored.</t>

<t>When no parameters are required by the definition of a given Wide Community,
the Wide Community Paramters TLV SHOULD NOT be encoded in the community.
Implementations MUST be prepared to accept a Wide Community Parameter TLV with
an empty value field.</t>

<section title="Usage">

<t> The detailed interpretation of the targets or parameters SHALL be provided
when describing given community type in a separate document or when locally
defined by an operator.</t>

<section title="Well Known Standard BGP Communities">

<t>According to RFC 1997, as well as IANA's 
Well-Known BGP Communities registry, the following 
BGP communities are defined to have global significance: </t>

<t>This document recommends for simplicity as well as for avoidance of
backward compatibility issues the continued use of BGP Standard Community
Attribute type 8 as defined in RFC 1997 to distribute non Autonomous System
specific Well-Known BGP Communities.</t>

<t>For the same reason, this document does not intended to 
obsolete the currently defined and deployed BGP Extended Communities.</t>

</section>

<section title="Operational considerations">

<t>Having two different ways to propagate locally assigned BGP communities,
one via the use of Standard BGP Communities and the other one via the use of
Wide BGP Communities, may seem to potentially cause problems when considering
propagation of conflicting actions.  However, even at present, an operator may
append Standard BGP Communities with conflicting information.  It is therefore
recommended that any implementation, in supporting both standard and Wide BGP
communities, allow for their easy inbound and outbound processing. The actual
execution of all communities should be treated as a union and, if supported by
an implementation, their execution permissions are to be a local configuration
matter.</t>

<section title="Example"> 

<section title="Example Wide Community Definition">

<section title="IANA Considerations">

<t>This document defines a new BGP Path Attribute called Wide BGP 
Community Attribute. For this new type IANA is to allocate a new 
value in the corresponding registry:</t>

<t>Registry Name: BGP Path Attributes </t>
 
<t>This document makes the following assignments for the optional, 
transitive Wide BGP Communities Attribute:</t>

<t>This document requests IANA to define and maintain a new registry
named: "Wide BGP Communities sub-TLV types".  The pool of 0x0000-0xFFFF has
been defined for its allocations.  This document defines type 1.  Types 2-1024
are to be allocated using an IETF Consensus policy.  Types 1024-64511 are to be
allocated on a first come, first served basis.  Types 64512-65534 are to be
reserved for experimental use.</t>
