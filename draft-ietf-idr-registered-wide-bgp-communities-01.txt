                  Registered Wide BGP Community Values
           draft-ietf-idr-registered-wide-bgp-communities-01

Abstract

   Communicating various routing policies via route tagging plays an
   important role in external BGP peering relations.  The most common
   tool used today to attach various information about routes is
   realized with the use of BGP communities.  Such information is
   important for the peering AS to perform some mutually agreed actions
   without the need to maintain a separate offline database for each
   pair of prefix and an associated with it requested set of action
   entries.

   This document proposes to establish a new IANA maintained registry of
   most commonly used Wide BGP Communities by network operators.  Such
   public registry will allow for easy refernece and clear
   interpretation of the actions associated with received community
   values.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 1997 [RFC1997] defines a BGP Community Attribute to be used as a
   tool to contain in BGP update message various additional information
   about routes which may help to automate peering administration.  As
   defined in RFC 1997 [RFC1997] BGP Communities attribute consists of
   one or more sets of four octet values, where each one of them

Internet-Draft       registered-wide-bgp-communities       November 2015


   specifies a different community.  Except two reserved ranges the
   encoding of community values mandates that first two octets are to
   contain the Autonomous System number followed by next two octets
   containing locally defined value.

   This document lists the most commonly used today BGP communities as
   well as provides a new registry for future definitions.

2.  Globally significant pre-defined values

2.1.  Well Known Standard BGP Communities

   According to RFC 1997 as well as to IANA's Well-Known BGP Communities
   registry today the following BGP communities are defined to have
   global significance:

     +------------+---------------------+----------------------------+
     | 0xFFFF0000 | planned-shut        | [draft-francois-bgp-gshut] |
     | 0xFFFFFF01 | NO_EXPORT           | [RFC1997]                  |
     | 0xFFFFFF02 | NO_ADVERTISE        | [RFC1997]                  |
     | 0xFFFFFF03 | NO_EXPORT_SUBCONFED | [RFC1997]                  |
     | 0xFFFFFF04 | NOPEER              | [RFC3765]                  |
     +------------+---------------------+----------------------------+

   This document recommends for simplicity as well as for avoidance of
   backward compatibility issues the continued use of BGP Standard
   Community Attribute type 8 as defined in RFC 1997 to distribute non
   Autonomous System specific Well-Known BGP Communities.

   For the same reason the described registry does not intend to
   obsolete BGP Extended Community Attribute and any already defined and
   deployed extended communities.  The new registry is to be used
   primarly for new community definitions in particular those which
   require to carry various new parameters or which should be propagated
   with a controled scope and radius.

2.2.  Registered pre-defined Wide BGP Communities

   It has been requested numerous times to have a globally unified way
   to express some particular Autonomous System based routing policies.
   When defining a new way to encode bgp communities we have an
   opportunity to define set of new registered routing policies and
   route markings which could be passed within and between Autonomous
   Systems resulting in their common interpretation.

   This document will request IANA to define and maintain a new registry
   for pre-defined Wide BGP Community values.  The allocation policy is
   on a first come first served basis.

   It is recommended that an implementation supports by an explicit
   enabling defined below Registered Wide BGP Communities.  Depending on
   the BGP implementation support it is recommended that an
   implementation would support Registered Wide BGP Communities without
   breaking static or dynamic peer/update groups.  However it needs to
   be pointed out that support of all Registered Wide BGP Communities is
   not mandatory.  It will be perfectly valid for any BGP implementation
   to support only subset of Wide BGP Communities.

   It is strongly advised that each Autonomous System does an inbound
   verification of received Wide BGP Communities from all of its EBGP
   peers before accepting them and propagating within their own domain.

   The document does not mandate nor enforces that given registered type
   value of Wide BGP Community would be of transitive or non-transitive
   type.  It is for the operator to determine the propagation AS radius
   required for such community when appending it to routing information.
   However the document will provide a transitivity radius
   recommendation to defined communities.

   The following Wide BGP Communities have global significance and their
   execution should be uniformly implemented by any BGP speaker
   supporting given set of Wide BGP Communities.

   The defined below value of the community should be interpreted as
   registered value only if "R" - registered bit is set in the community
   Type 1 container as described in [draft-raszuk-wide-bgp-communities]
   Otherwise the value is local and it's actions is locally defined by
   the operator.

2.2.1.  General Registered Wide BGP Community Values

   The below set of communities will be defined to be carried in Wide
   BGP Community Type 1, with the container type values (Community
   Registered Value) as per Section 6.

       R = IANA assigned           P = none

   DESCRIPTION - The ATTACK_TARGET Registered Wide BGP Community
   indicates that BGP prefixes carrying such community are receiving
   unusual amount of unwanted traffic most likely due to some form of
   network attack.  Network devices capable of analyzing and mitigating
   such attacks can use such community as a hint on what destinations to
   focus the most.

   DESCRIPTION - All routes received which carry such Wide BGP Community
   containing this value MUST NOT be advertised to BGP peer which
   Autonomous System number has been listed in the TARGET TLV field of
   this community.

   Semantically specifying the reserved Autonomous System value of
   0xFFFFFFFF (ANY AS) would be an equivalent of using NO_ADVERTISE
   Well-Known Standard BGP Community Attribute.

   System number is specified in the TARGET TLV field of this community
   with NO_EXPORT Standard BGP Community attached.

   Semantically specifying in TARGET TLV the reserved Autonomous System

   DESCRIPTION - The Autonomous System advertising routes externally
   should prepend N times (encoded as 0xAA) its own Autonomous System
   number when advertising routes tagged with this community to peer
   which AS number is defined by TARGET TLV field.  Number of requested
   AS prepends is provided in the PARAMETERS TLV field.  Post execution
   this community MUST be removed.

   DESCRIPTION - All routes marked with such community advertised by an
   Autonomous System to all of its external peers should have any
   occurrence of an Autonomous System number specified in the TARGET TLV
   field replaced with advertising domain's local Autonomous System
   number.  Post execution this community MUST be removed.

2.2.6.  Local Preference Registered Community

   LOCAL PREFERENCE
       Type: 0x0001                S = src AS #

       R = IANA assigned           P = Type_4 (0xAA) max AS_PATH radius

   DESCRIPTION - Autonomous System may suggest to drop advertised prefix
   by any transit network if its AS_PATH attribute length would be equal
   or greater to encoded value both inbound or outbound of EBGP session.
   The value of max AS_PATH length allowed is specified in the
   PARAMETERS TLV field of the community.  Post comparison this
   community MUST be kept.

2.2.8.  GEO-LOCATION Registered Community

   GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION WHERE BGP ROUTE IS INTRODUCED TO AS
       Type: 0x0001                S = src AS #
       F = 0x80                    C = 0x00000000
       H = Operator's defined      T = none

       R = IANA assigned           P = Type_8 (5 UTF-8 characters)

   DESCRIPTION - Autonomous Systems may attach this community to routes
   received from EBGP neighbors or introduced to BGP by other routing
   protocols to identify the geographic location where the route was
   introduced to the AS.  The "right-most" two octets of PARAMETERS TLV
   correspond to an ISO3166-1 alpha-2 country identifier, while the
   "left-most" three octets may express a more specific geographic
   location, such as a city or IXP encoded in 3 octets.

   Example:

   Wide BGP Community describing route learnt by the AS at London, GB
        HOP COUNT - operator defined
        LENGTH - 26
        PARAMETERS - 3 octets locality string + 2 octets country id.

   AS_PATH TTL MAX RADIUS
       Type: 0x0001                S = src AS #

       R = IANA assigned           P = Type_4 (0xAA) max AS_PATH radius

   DESCRIPTION - In multistage networks with large scale Equal Cost
   MultiPath (ECMP), it is often useful to separate flows towards a
   single destination among different paths along the parallel set at
   each stage.  This wide community allows the operator to send a "hint"
   to the ingress router on how to set either the MPLS entropy label
   [RFC6790] or the IPv6 flow label [RFC3697] to achieve such flow
   separation.  The Integer list given in the community can contain a
   label that is used by the receiver: Directly as an IPv6 flow label,
   Directly as an MPLS entropy label, As a seed used to calculate either
   a flow or entropy label

5.  Security considerations

   All the security considerations for BGP Communities as well as for
   BGP Extended Communities RFCs apply here.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to define and maintain a new registry
   named: "Registered Wide BGP Communities Values".  The reserved pool
   of 0x00000000-0xFFFFFFFF has been defined for its allocations.  The
   allocation policy is on a first come first served basis.

   This document makes the following assignments for the Registered Wide
   BGP Community values:
