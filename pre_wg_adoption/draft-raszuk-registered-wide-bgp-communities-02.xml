<abstract>
   
<t>Communicating various routing policies via route tagging 
plays an important role in external BGP peering relations. 
The most common tool used today to attach various information
about routes is realized with the use of BGP communities. 
Such information is important for the peering AS to perform 
some mutually agreed actions without the need to maintain a 
separate offline database for each pair of prefix and an 
associated with it requested set of action entries.</t>

<t>This document proposes to establish a new IANA maintained 
registry of most commonly used Wide BGP Communities by network 
operators. Such public registry will allow for easy refernece 
and clear interpretation of the actions associated with received
community values.</t>

</abstract>

<section title="Introduction">

<t><xref target="RFC1997">RFC 1997</xref> defines a BGP 
Community Attribute to be used as a tool to contain in BGP
update message various additional information about routes 
which may help to automate peering administration. As defined 
in <xref target="RFC1997">RFC 1997</xref> BGP Communities 
attribute consists of one or more sets of four octet values, 
where each one of them specifies a different community. Except
two reserved ranges the encoding of community values mandates 
that first two octets are to contain the Autonomous System 
number followed by next two octets containing locally defined 
value.</t>

<t>This document lists the most commonly used today BGP 
communities as well as provides a new registry for future 
definitions.</t>

</section>

<section title="Globally significant pre-defined values">

<section title="Well Known Standard BGP Communities">
<t>According to RFC 1997 as well as to IANA's 
Well-Known BGP Communities registry today the following 
BGP communities are defined to have global significance:</t>
  <texttable>
  
  <ttcol/><ttcol/><ttcol/>

  <c>0xFFFF0000</c><c>   planned-shut</c><c>  [draft-francois-bgp-gshut]</c>	
  <c>0xFFFFFF01</c><c>   NO_EXPORT   </c><c>         [RFC1997]</c>
  <c>0xFFFFFF02</c><c>   NO_ADVERTISE </c><c>        [RFC1997]</c>
  <c>0xFFFFFF03</c><c>   NO_EXPORT_SUBCONFED</c><c>  [RFC1997]</c>
  <c>0xFFFFFF04</c><c>   NOPEER </c><c>              [RFC3765]</c>

  </texttable>

<t> This document recommends for simplicity as well as for avoidance of backward compatibility issues the continued use of BGP Standard Community Attribute type 8 as defined in RFC 1997 to distribute non Autonomous System specific Well-Known BGP Communities.</t>

<t>For the same reason the described registry does not intend to 
obsolete BGP Extended Community Attribute and any already defined 
and deployed extended communities. The new registry is to be used 
primarly for new community definitions in particular those which 
require to carry various new parameters or which should be propagated with a controled scope and radius.</t>

</section>

<section title="Registered pre-defined Wide BGP Communities">

 <t> It has been requested numerous times to have a globally unified way to express some particular Autonomous System based routing policies. When defining a new way to encode bgp communities we have an opportunity to define set of new registered routing policies and route markings which could be passed within and between Autonomous Systems resulting in their common interpretation.</t>
  
 <t> This document will request IANA to define and maintain a new 
 registry for pre-defined Wide BGP Community values. The allocation policy is on a first come first served basis.</t>

 <t> It is recommended that an implementation supports by an 
 explicit enabling defined below Registered Wide BGP Communities. 
 Depending on the BGP implementation support it is recommended that an implementation would support Registered Wide BGP Communities without breaking static or dynamic peer/update groups. However it needs to be pointed out that support of all Registered Wide BGP Communities is not mandatory. It will be perfectly valid for any BGP implementation to support only subset of Wide BGP Communities.
 </t> 
  
 <t> It is strongly advised that each Autonomous System does an 
 inbound verification of received Wide BGP Communities from all 
 of its EBGP peers before accepting them and propagating within
 their own domain.</t>
 
 <t> The document does not mandate nor enforces that given 
 registered type value of Wide BGP Community would be of transitive or non-transitive type. It is for the operator to determine the propagation AS radius required for such community when appending it to routing information. However the document will provide a transitivity radius recommendation to defined communities.</t>
 
 <t>The following Wide BGP Communities have global significance 
 and their execution should be uniformly implemented by any BGP 
 speaker supporting given set of Wide BGP Communities.</t>
 
 <t>The defined below value of the community should be interpreted 
 as registered value only if "R" - registered bit is set in the 
 community Type 1 container as described in [draft-raszuk-wide-bgp-communities] Otherwise the value is local 
 and it's actions is locally defined by the operator.</t>

  <section title="General Registered Wide BGP Community Values">

  <t>The below set of communities will be defined to be carried 
  in Wide BGP Community Type 1, with the container type values as per
  <xref target="iana"/>.</t>

>     GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION WHERE BGP ROUTE IS INTRODUCED TO AS
> 
>          TTL - Operator's defined
>          LENGTH - 15 octets + optional locality string length
>          PARAMETERS - locality string - 0 to ? octets
>                       country identifier - 2 octets
>      DESCRIPTION - Autonomous Systems may attach this community to routes
> received from EBGP neighbors or introduced to BGP by other routing protocols
> to identify the geographic location where the route was introduced to the AS.
> The "right-most" two octets MUST? correspond to an ISO3166-1 alpha-2
> country identifier, while the optional "left-most" octets may express a more
> specific geographic location, such as a city or IXP.
> 
> 3. Example

>      heading stating route learnt by the AS at London, Great Britain
>          TTL - operator defined
