                   BGP Community Container Attribute
                 draft-ietf-idr-wide-bgp-communities-04

Abstract

   Route tagging plays an important role in external BGP [RFC4271]
   relations, in communicating various routing policies between peers.
   It is also a very common best practice among operators to propagate
   various additional information about routes intra-domain.  The most
   common tool used today to attach various information about routes is
   through the use of BGP communities [RFC1997].

   This document defines a new encoding which will enhance and simplify
   what can be accomplished today with the use of BGP communities.  The
   most important addition this specification makes over currently
   defined BGP communities is the ability to specify, carry as well as
   use for execution an operator's defined set of parameters.  It also
   provides an extensible platform for any new community encoding needs
   in the future.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 1997 [RFC1997] defines the BGP Community Attribute.  This
   attribute is used as a tool to carry additional information in BGP
   routes which may help to automate peering administration.  The BGP
   Communities Attribute consists of a set of one or more four-octet
   values, where each specifies a different community.  Except for two
   reserved ranges, the encoding of community values mandates that the
   first two octets are to contain the Autonomous System number, with
   the next two octets containing some locally defined value.

   Since the introduction of [RFC1997], numerous additional mechanisms
   have been introduced to provide BGP Community-like functionality.
   Each of these mechanisms introduce a new syntax, typically covered by
   its encoding with the BGP Path Attribute that defines it, and a
   semantic space.

Internet-Draft           BGP Community Container              March 2017


   The authors believe that defining a new BGP Path Attribute, with the
   ability to contain locally defined parameters will enhance the
   current level of network policies, as well as simplify BGP policy
   management.  The proposed encoding will also facilitate the delivery
   of new network services without a need to define a new BGP extension
   each time.

   When defining any new type of tool there is always a unique
   opportunity to specify a subset of well recognized behaviors.  Lists
   of the current most commonly used BGP communities, as well as
   provision for a new registry for future definitions will be contained
   in a separate document.

2.  Protocol Summary

   This specification defines a new BGP Path Attribute, the BGP
   Community Container.  It carries a series of BGP Community Container
   types, each prefaced with the BGP Community Container Common Header.

   This specification also defines the BGP Wide Community Container.

2.1.  BGP Community Container Common Header

   The BGP Community Container Common Header permits Community-like
   attributes to be grouped under a single BGP Path Attribute.  This
   provides hierarchy for future Community-like features.  It permits
   implementations without knowledge of a specific Community Container's
   format to address that Community Container by its code point.  It
   also permits common enforcement of the Community Container's
   transitivity across AS boundaries without need for the implementation
   to understand a specific Container's implementation.

   The BGP Community Container Common Header is defined in Section 3.1
   and contains following encoding:

   Container Type:
       Container Type 1, BGP Wide Community is defined in this document.

   Flags:
       Flags control common behavior including the transitivity of the
       Container.

   Length:
       Length of the Container contents.

2.2.  Community Containers

   This document defines one Community Container with the following
   encoding:

2.2.1.  Type 1: BGP Wide Community

   The container type 1 "BGP Wide Community TLVs" is defined in
   Section 4.

   Community Value:
       This section defines the action that an operator wishes a router
       to take.

   Source AS:
       This is the AS originating the community.

   Context AS:
       AS that defines and provides the semantics to interpret this
       Community.

   Target(s):
       This is an optional list that encodes where the community's
       action should be taken.

   Exclude Target(s):
       This is an optional list that encodes where the community's
       actions should not be taken.

   Parameters:
       This is an optional list of Atoms that encodes additional
       information that the community's action needs to execute
       properly.

2.3.  BGP Community Container Atoms

   Atoms provide data types that can be used to encode contents of BGP
   Community Containers.  They are in the format of TLVs and are defined
   later in this document in Section 5.

3.  BGP Community Container Attribute

   This document defines a new BGP Path Attribute, the BGP Community
   Container.  The attribute type code is TBD.

   The BGP Community Container attribute is an optional, transitive BGP
   attribute, and may be present only once in the BGP UPDATE message.

   The attribute contains a set of typed containers.  Any given
   container type may appear multiple times, unless that container
   type's definition specifies otherwise.

3.1.  BGP Community Container Attribute Common Header

   Containers always start with the following common header:

      0                   1                   2                   3

   This document defines container type 1.  See the Section 11 for
   information on additional type registration policies.

   +------+-------+----------------------------------------------------+

   |  T   |   0   | Not Transitive across administrative boundary.     |

   +------+-------+----------------------------------------------------+

                              Table 1: Flags

   Flags are defined globally and apply to all container types.

   Bit 0 (T bit) Transitivity bit:

      When not set (value 0), the community in the container is
      transitive across AS boundaries, but not across an administrative
      boundary.

      When set (value 1), the community in the container is transitive
      across all ASes.  An administrative boundary, in this sense, is an
      arbitrary set of connected ASes, possibly under control of a
      single entity.  How such an administrative boundary is determined
      is out of scope of this document.

   Bit 1 (C bit) Confederation bit:

      The confederation bit is used to manage the propagation scope of a
      given BGP Wide Community across confederation boundaries.

      When not set (value 0) community is not transitive across
      confederation sub-AS boundary.  When set (value of 1) indicates
      that community in a given container is transitive across
      confederation boundary.

   The Reserved field MUST be set to zero when originated and SHOULD be
   ignored upon receipt.

   The Length field represents the total length of a given container's
   contents in octets.

4.  BGP Community Container, Type 1: BGP Wide Community

   The Type 1 BGP Community Container, the BGP Wide Community, is of
   variable size (but minimum length 12).  It is composed of a fixed
   12-octets - containing the Community Value, the Source AS Number, and
   the Context AS Number - followed by optional TLVs:

      0                   1                   2                   3

                   Figure 2: Type 1, BGP Wide Community

4.1.  Community Value

   Community Value: 4 octets

   The Community Value indicates what set of actions a router is
   requested to take upon reception of a route containing this
   community.  The semantics of this value depend on whether this is a
   private/local community or IANA registered.

Internet-Draft           BGP Community Container              March 2017


   When the high order bit of the Community Value field - I - is set,
   the value is IANA Registered and has a well defined meaning with
   underlying semantics.  See the documentation for each Registered BGP
   Wide Community for its semantics and validation requirements.

   When the high order bit of the Community Value field is clear, the
   value is Locally defined and has semantics solely within the control
   of the AS defining that community.  The Context AS Number provides
   the namespace in which this Community Value is interpreted.  It is
   that AS's responsibility to provide the semantics and validation
   requirements for that BGP Wide Community.

   See Section 11.5 for code point space partitioning.

4.2.  Source AS Number

   Source Autonomous System Number: 4 octets

   The Autonomous System number indicates the AS originating this BGP
   Wide Community.

4.3.  Context AS Number

   Context Autonomous System Number: 4 octets

   This identifies the AS that provides the semantics to interpret this
   Community.

4.4.  BGP Wide Community TLVs

   Optional type 1 container TLVs are encoded in the following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3

   Length:
       Length of the "Value" field in octets.

   Value:
       Specific to the underlying Sub-Type.

4.4.1.  Sub-Type 1, BGP Wide Community Target(s) TLV

   The value field of the Wide Community Target(s) TLV (Sub-Type 1) is a
   series of Atom TLVs.  The semantics of any given Atom TLV MUST be
   part of the definition of a given Wide Community.

   BGP Wide Community Targets define the matching criteria for the
   community.  A given wide community may have a number of targets that
   it applies to.  The semantics of these targets will vary on a per
   community basis.  Depending on the definition of the community,
   targets may be optional.

   Wide Community Targets consist of a series of Atoms that have "match
   any" semantics.  Thus, if any given target matches per the semantics
   of that Atom for the community, the community is considered to match
   and the action defined by the community should be executed.

   When no Target(s) TLV is specified, it is considered "match all".

   If the semantics of a given Atom is undefined for the community in
   question, this Atom MUST be ignored.

   When no targets are required by the definition of a given Wide
   Community, the Wide Community Target(s) TLV SHOULD NOT be encoded in
   the community.  Implementations MUST be prepared to accept a Wide
   Community Target(s) TLV with an empty value field.

4.4.2.  Sub-Type 2, BGP Wide Community Exclude Target(s) TLV

   The BGP Wide Community Exclude Target(s) TLV (Sub-Type 2) contains a
   list of a Atoms.

   Wide Community Exclude Targets define criteria by which the community
   is considered to NOT match.  Depending on the semantics of the BGP
   Wide Community, Exclude Target(s) may be optional.

   The semantic of the BGP Wide Community Exclude Target(s) is to match
   all specified Target(s) with the exception of those listed in this
   TLV.

   The value field of the BGP Wide Community Exclude Target(s) TLV is a
   series of BGP Wide Community Atom TLVs.  The semantics of any given
   Atom TLV MUST be part of the definition of a given Wide Community.

   If the semantics of a given Atom is undefined for the community in
   question, this Atom MUST be ignored.

   If the BGP Wide Community Target(s) TLV and the BGP Wide Community
   Exclude Target(s) TLV have conflicting semantics, priority MUST be
   given to the Wide Community Exclude Target(s) TLV.

   When no exclude targets are required by the definition of a given BGP
   Wide Community, the BGP Wide Community Exclude Target(s) TLV SHOULD
   NOT be encoded in the community.  Implementations MUST be prepared to
   accept a BGP Wide Community Exclude Target(s) TLV with an empty value
   field.

4.4.3.  Sub-Type 3, BGP Wide Community Parameter(s) TLV

   The BGP Wide Community Parameter(s) TLV (Sub-Type 3) contains a list
   of a Atoms.

   A given BGP Wide Community may have parameters that are used as
   inputs for executing actions defined for that community.  These
   parameters, and any constraints implied by the parameters, MUST be
   defined by the wide community definition.  Parameters consist of an
   ordered set of Atom sub-TLVs.  The semantics of any specific
   positional instance of an Atom MUST be defined by the wide community.

   Care must be taken when using Atoms with list semantics.  If the
   desired behavior is a single or limited number of instances of that
   type, this should be documented as part of the use case of that BGP
   Wide Community.

   If it is the case that a parameter for a given community is of an
   unexpected type or length, the BGP Wide Community MUST be ignored.

   If it is the case that there are too many or two few parameters for a
   given community, the BGP Wide Community MUST be ignored.

   When no parameters are required by the definition of a given Wide
   Community, the Wide Community Parameters TLV SHOULD NOT be encoded in
   the community.  Implementations MUST be prepared to accept a Wide
   Community Parameter TLV with an empty value field.

4.4.4.  Usage

   The detailed interpretation of the targets or parameters SHALL be
   provided when describing given community type in a separate document
   or when locally defined by an operator.

5.  BGP Community Container Atoms

   Some types of BGP Community Contaners, for example BGP Wide
   Communities, will act on and hence need to encode some distinct Atoms
   of data.  Use of Atoms is solely subject to definition of the
   specific BGP Container type.  Atoms are encoded as TLVs, where each
   TLV has the following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |     Type      |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |            Length             |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                         Value (variable)                      |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                           Figure 4: Atoms TLVs

   The Type field contains a value of 1-254.  The values 0 and 255 are
   reserved for future use.  The TLV types are to be assigned and
   maintained by IANA registry; see Section 11.2.

   The Length represents the length of the "Value" field in octets.

   The Value field contains the TLV value.

   Supported format of the TLVs can be:

     Type  1: Autonomous System Number List.
     Type  2: IPv4 Prefix (1 octet prefix length + prefix) List.
     Type  3: IPv6 Prefix (1 octet prefix length + prefix) List.
     Type  4: Integer32 List.
     Type  5: IEEE Floating Point Number List.
     Type  6: Neighbor Class List.
     Type  7: User-defined Class List.
     Type  8: UTF-8 String.

   The semantics of a given Atom will depend upon the context in which
   it is used, as defined by the containing wide community.

Internet-Draft           BGP Community Container              March 2017


   In the following sections defining the different Atoms, validation
   rules for the Length of the Atom will be presented.  If the Length of
   the Atom does not match the rules for that Atom, it SHALL be
   considered malformed.  (See Section 8.)

   In general, Atoms of List type have the semantics of sets.  Duplicate
   entries SHOULD NOT be present and MAY be removed by BGP Speaker
   propagating the Lists.  The presence of duplicate entries have no
   additional semantics.

5.1.  Atom Type 1, The Autonomous System Number List

   This Atom represents a list of Autonomous System numbers, each 4
   octets in size.  When encoding two octet ASes, the first two octets
   of this four octet value MUST be filled with zeros.  The minimum
   Length of this Atom is 4 octets.  The Length MUST be a multiple of 4.

   Two special values are reserved for the Autonomous System Atoms:

     0x00000000 - to indicate "No Autonomous Systems".
     0xFFFFFFFF - to indicate "All Autonomous Systems".

5.2.  Atom Types 2 and 3, The IPv4 and IPv6 Prefix Lists

   This Atom represents a list of IPv4 or IPv6 prefixes.  IPv4 and IPv6
   Prefix Atom values are encoded in the same format used by BGP NLRI in
   Section 4.3 of [RFC4271].


                       +---------------------------+
                       |  Prefix Length (1 octet)  |
                       +---------------------------+
                       |  Prefix (variable)        |
                       +---------------------------+

                         Figure 5: IP prefix atoms

   The Prefix Length for IPv4 prefixes MUST be in the range of 0..32.

   The Prefix Length for IPv6 prefixes MUST be in the range of 0..128.

   The Length field must be able to accommodate the list of prefixes
   according to the encoding rules.  If the Length cannot fully
   accommodate the required number of octets to encode the Prefix Length
   and the Prefix, the Atom is considered malformed.

Internet-Draft           BGP Community Container              March 2017


5.3.  Atom Type 4, The Integer32 List

   This Atom represents a list of four-octet Integers.  These Integers
   are stored in network byte order.

   The minimum Length of the Integer32 list Atom is 4 octets.  The
   Length MUST be a multiple of 4.

5.4.  Atom Type 5, The IEEE Floating Point Number List

   This Atom represents a list of floating point numbers.  Floating
   point numbers are a fixed Length of 4 octets and are stored in
   [IEEE.754.1985] format.

   The minimum Length of the Floating Point Number list Atom is 4
   octets.  The Length MUST be a multiple of 4.

5.5.  Atom Type 6, The Neighbor Class List

   The Neighbor Class list Atom represents a list of Neighbor classes,
   each 4 octets in size.  Neighbor class currently can contain three
   values:

   Peer (1):
       This class is typically applied to sessions where a transit-free
       relationship exists between two providers.

   Customer (2):
       This class is typically applied to sessions where the remote end
       of the session is operated by a customer.

   Upstream (3):
       This class is typically applied to sessions where the remote end
       of the session is operated by a network from which you receive
       transit routes.

   The minimum Length of the Neighbor Class list Atom is 4 octets.  The
   Length MUST be a multiple of 4.

5.6.  Atom Type 7, The User-defined Class List

   The User-defined Class list Atom represents a list of user-defined
   class, each 4 octets in size.  The exact property definition is up to
   the semantics of the defining Autonomous System.  The semantics
   governing a given User-defined Class list are defined by the Context
   AS Number and the Community Value.





Raszuk, et al.          Expires September 3, 2017              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft           BGP Community Container              March 2017


   Examples of User-defined Class properties include geography (East,
   West), continent (North America, Asia, Europe), etc.  Similar to the
   [RFC1997] BGP Communities, it is necessary that the Context AS
   provide a registry of the value and the semantics of a given
   community.

   The minimum Length of the User-defined Class list Atom is 4 octets.
   The Length of this Atom MUST be a multiple of 4.

5.7.  Atom Type 8, the UTF-8 String

   The UTF-8 String Atom represents an arbitrary Unicode string in UTF-8
   [RFC3629] format.  The Length is required to be of sufficient size to
   carry the UTF-8 string in the Value field.

   Implementations MUST be prepared for truncated/improperly formed
   UTF-8 strings.  When detecting such a string, the implementation
   should remove trailing octets of a multi-octet sequence in order to
   have a well-formed string.

   Implementations MUST be prepared to receive empty (zero-Length) UTF-8
   String Atoms as they may be used as Parameters.

6.  Well Known Standard BGP Communities

   According to RFC 1997, as well as IANA's Well-Known BGP Communities
   registry, the following BGP communities are defined to have global
   significance:

        0xFFFF0000   planned-shut         [draft-francois-bgp-gshut]
        0xFFFFFF01   NO_EXPORT            [RFC1997]
        0xFFFFFF02   NO_ADVERTISE         [RFC1997]
        0xFFFFFF03   NO_EXPORT_SUBCONFED  [RFC1997]
        0xFFFFFF04   NOPEER               [RFC3765]

   This document recommends for simplicity as well as for avoidance of
   backward compatibility issues the continued use of BGP Standard
   Community Path Attribute, type 8, as defined in RFC 1997 to
   distribute non-Autonomous System specific Well-Known BGP Communities.

   For the same reason, this document does not intend to obsolete the
   currently defined and deployed BGP Extended Communities.

7.  Operational Considerations

   Having multiple ways to propagate locally assigned BGP Communities -
   via the use of Standard, Extended or Large BGP Communities versus the
   use of BGP Wide Communities - may seem to potentially cause problems



Raszuk, et al.          Expires September 3, 2017              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft           BGP Community Container              March 2017


   when considering propagation of conflicting actions.  However, even
   at present, an operator may append such Communities with conflicting
   information.  It is therefore recommended that any implementation, in
   supporting both standard and BGP Wide Communities, allow for their
   easy inbound and outbound processing.  The actual execution of all
   communities should be treated as a union and, if supported by an
   implementation, their execution permissions are to be a local
   configuration matter.

8.  Error Handling

8.1.  General Error Handling for BGP Community Containers

   [RFC7606] "treat as withdraw" behavior is expected for any malformed
   Community Containers or malformation of their contents.

   Each Community Container type may have additional validation rules,
   including permitted length of Atoms.  Failure to conform to those
   additional rules MUST also be treated as a malformed Community
   Container.

8.2.  BGP Wide Community Container Error Handling

   If any Atom in a BGP Wide Community container's Exclude Targets TLV
   is unrecognized, that Wide Community MUST NOT be considered a match
   and no actions for that community should be processed.  While the
   Targets TLV is meant to be inclusive, the Exclude Targets TLV is
   meant to be proscriptive of applying the action.

9.  Example

9.1.  Example Type 1 Wide Community Definition

   An operator of an AS 64496, wishes to locally define a Wide Community
   with the semantics of permitting AS_PATH prepending with targets that
   include AS numbers of peer ASes and peers who have been marked with a
   set of enumerated city locations.  AS 64496 has selected Community
   Value 1 to represent this functionality.

   AS 64496 has established a registered set of values to use for its
   User-defined Class:

      100 - Amsterdam
      101 - New York
      102 - San Francisco
      103 - Tokyo
      104 - Moscow

Internet-Draft           BGP Community Container              March 2017


   Target semantics:

      The Autonomous System Number list Atom refers to the target peer
      AS Numbers.

      The User-defined Class for AS 64496 has been defined elsewhere and
      the values 100..104 may be used for this locally defined Wide
      Community.

      The Targets TLV MUST contain at least one entry.

      The Exclude Targets TLV MAY contain entries of the above supported
      Atoms.

      The semantics of all other Atoms are undefined for this community.

   Parameter semantics:

      The parameter TLV shall consist of exactly one Integer32 Atom
      value that is constrained to have a value of 2..8.

9.2.  Example Type 1 BGP Wide Community Encoding

   AS_PATH prepend 4 TIMES TO AS 2424, AS 8888, to peers marked as
   Amsterdam (100) or to peers marked Moscow (104), but not to peers in
   New York (101).

   The T Flag (transitive) is set to prevent propagation of this
   community.

10.1.  BGP Community Container Security Considerations

   Transitive BGP Community Container communities could unintentionally
   spread far from their origin.  If a router receives many routes from
   multiple sources on the Internet with different communities, it could
   cause significant memory usage.  To prevent excessive memory usage,
   routers should be configured to strip unexpected communities from
   received routes.

   All the security considerations for BGP Communities [RFC1997] or BGP
   Extended Communities [RFC4360] apply to BGP Community Containers.

10.2.  BGP Wide Community Security Considerations

   For BGP Wide Communities, the Community Value the Source AS may
   provide sufficient context to strip unwanted or unexpected
   communities.

   Given the flexibility and power offered by BGP Wide communities, it
   is important to consider the additional possibilities allowed by
   their definition.  In particular, for locally defined BGP Wide
   Communities, it may be wise to restrict the range of parameters.  For
   registered BGP Wide Communities, the security considerations of the
   document defining them MUST address issues specific to those newly
   defined Communities.

11.  IANA Considerations

11.1.  BGP Community Container Attribute

   This document defines a new BGP Path Attribute called BGP Community
   Container Attribute.  For this new type IANA is requested to allocate
   a new value in the corresponding registry:

   Registry Name: BGP Path Attributes

12.  Change History

12.1.  Working Group draft

   Changes from -03 to -04:

      Many editorial changes.

      Restored the structure of the common header to accommodate prior
      implementations from Huawei.  However, do not keep the Hop count
      per prior IDR and author discussion.

      Adopt the name BGP Community Container for the general feature and
      common header after discussion on IDR regarding Large BGP
      Communities.  Wide communities now specifically refer to the Type
      1 container.

      Updated the Common Container Header's definition of Length to only
      cover the length of the contents, and not the header.

      Hide the Type 2 (4:4), Type 3 (Nx4), Type 4 (16+Nx4) containers
      for now.

      Outstanding issues addresses and section removed.

      Type 1 container renamed from "Wide community" to "Wide community
      TLVs".

      Rename Integer Atom to Integer32.

      Example changed, following previous specification change.

   Changes from -02 to -03:

      Many editorial change.

      Introduction of new type of containers: Type 2 (4:4), Type 3
      (Nx4), Type 4 (16+Nx4)

      Common container header: Type length changed from 2-octets to 1
      octet, "Hop Count" removed, "Context AS number" moved from type 1
      to the generic header.

      Remove community "AS-4 List Generic Wide BGP Community"

   Changes from -00 to -02: no change

   00: no change

12.2.  Individual draft

   Changes from -03 via -04 to -05:

      Update the Introduction.

      Substantial re-work of Atom types removing proposed Group
      container and moving Atoms to be lists.

      Added the Exclude Targets TLV to the Wide Community container.

      Added a section on error handling.

      Updated the example.

   Changes from -02 to -03:

      Removed C and R named bit fields originally from -00.

      Rename Target AS field to Context AS.

      Make Integer Atom a fixed 4 octets in length.

      Add Neighbor Class Atom

      Rename TTL to Hop Count

   Changes from -01 to -02:

      The Type field has been expanded to 2 octets.

      The Length field has been moved to the common header.

      Changed format to use TLVs.

      Added Atom TLV to define well defined syntactic items.

      Added TLVs to distinguish targets from parameters.
